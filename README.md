# Neighbourhood Emergency Mobile Radio Plan
 - Simple yet structured plan for communication during events where traditional and more modern communication methods have broken down.
 - No licensed radios required. *PMR446* frequencies will be used, which is generally "Public Mobile Radio"; good walkie-talkies normally ship with these.
 - Localized communication for smaller areas.
